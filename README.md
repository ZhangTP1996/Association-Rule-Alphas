It is organized as follows:

* **Code**: This folder contains the Python implementation of the algorithms defined in the paper. You should change the data path in config.py first and run partition_data.py to get the itemset. Then you can run apriori.py to generate new rules. 

* **Data**: This folder contains the data of the public factors. The training set is in **TrainData**. The validation set and the test set are in **TestData** which are used in backtesting.
